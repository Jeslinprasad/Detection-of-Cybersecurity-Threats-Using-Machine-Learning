The project aims to build a machine-learning model that can automatically detect 
cybersecurity threats in network traffic. The project involves collecting and exploring a 
dataset of network traffic, pre-processing the data, training a machine learning model using 
decision trees, random forests, and deep learning techniques, and evaluating the model's 
performance using metrics such as accuracy.
